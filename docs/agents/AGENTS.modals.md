# Agent Zero — Frontend Modals (stacked `openModal/closeModal`)

This document covers the stacked modal system used by Agent Zero’s frontend, implemented in:

- `webui/js/modals.js`
- `webui/css/modals.css`

It also defines conventions for writing modal components in `webui/components/modals/` and `webui/components/settings/`.

> Legacy note: there is an older overlay / teleport modal style in the codebase (e.g. `x-teleport` + `.modal-overlay`). Avoid it for new work. This doc is about the stacked modal system.

## Prerequisites & concepts (quick orientation)

### Alpine.js and `$store`

The UI uses Alpine.js for reactivity (`x-show`, `x-if`, `x-on`, `x-model`, …). Stores are registered via `createStore()` and read in HTML via `$store.<storeName>`.

- Alpine initialization + lifecycle directives: `webui/js/initFw.js`
- Store wrapper: `webui/js/AlpineStore.js`

### `<x-component>` and `importComponent()`

Agent Zero uses a custom `<x-component path="...">` tag that is populated by the component loader.

The modal system does not rely on `<x-component>` directly; instead it calls the same loader function:

- `importComponent(path, targetElement)` from `webui/js/components.js`

That loader fetches component HTML, injects its `<style>` and `<script>` tags, and supports nested components.

---

## Why a “stacked modal system”?

Agent Zero can open modals from many places (sidebar, settings, message actions), and sometimes a modal opens another modal.

The stacked system provides:

- A single modal container structure for consistent UI
- A stack so nested modals work predictably
- A single backdrop that always sits behind the active modal
- A content loader that supports component HTML + `<style>` + `<script type="module">` the same way `<x-component>` does

---

## Core API

File: `webui/js/modals.js`

### `openModal(modalPath): Promise<void>`

- Creates a new modal element and pushes it onto a stack.
- Loads modal contents into the modal body by calling the component loader (`importComponent`).
- Resolves the returned promise when the modal element is removed from the DOM.

Edge cases / failure behavior (current implementation):

- Invalid `modalPath` does not reject the returned promise. Instead, the modal remains open and shows an error message inside the modal body; the promise still resolves when the user closes the modal.
- Calling `openModal()` multiple times with the same `modalPath` creates multiple modal instances (no deduping).

Modal paths are component paths, e.g.:

- `modals/file-browser/file-browser.html`
- `modals/history/history.html`
- `settings/settings.html`

### `closeModal(modalPath?: string): void`

- If no path is passed, closes the top modal.
- If `modalPath` is passed, finds and closes that modal in the stack.

Edge cases / failure behavior:

- If the stack is empty, `closeModal()` is a no-op.
- If `modalPath` is provided but not found, it is a no-op.

### `scrollModal(id: string): void`

Scrolls within the top modal’s `.modal-scroll` to an element by id.

---

## Modal DOM structure (what `modals.js` creates)

When `openModal()` runs, it creates this outer shell:

- `.modal` (full-screen fixed overlay container)
  - `.modal-inner`
    - `.modal-header` (title + close button)
    - `.modal-scroll`
      - `.modal-bd` (where the component HTML is imported)
    - `.modal-footer-slot` (used when the modal provides a footer)

The component HTML is imported into `.modal-bd`.

The title is taken from `<title>` inside the imported document (fallback: the modalPath).

### Sizing and scrolling (CSS behavior)

File: `webui/css/modals.css`

- `.modal` is full-screen fixed positioning.
- `.modal-inner` is centered and constrained:
  - `width: 90%`
  - `max-width: 960px`
  - `max-height: 90vh`
- Tall modals scroll inside `.modal-scroll` (`overflow-y: auto`).
- If the modal provides a footer, `.modal-footer-slot` is pinned under the scroll area (the body scrolls; the footer doesn’t).

---

## Footer support (`data-modal-footer`)

Some modals want a footer that stays fixed while the body scrolls.

Pattern:

- In your modal component HTML, include a footer element marked with `data-modal-footer`.
- `modals.js` will move that element out of the scroll area and into `.modal-footer-slot`.
- `modals.js` adds `.modal-with-footer` to `.modal-inner` so CSS can lay out the scroll area correctly.

Example patterns in the repo:

- `webui/components/settings/settings.html` (Save / Cancel footer)
- `webui/components/modals/file-browser/file-browser.html`
- `webui/components/modals/scheduler/scheduler-modal.html`

### Practical advice

- The footer element must exist *after the component is loaded*, but `modals.js` uses a `requestAnimationFrame` to let Alpine mount first.
- If you conditionally render the footer, keep it stable (don't constantly create/destroy it) or you'll fight the relocation.

## Shared CSS and button conventions

File: `webui/css/modals.css`

Modals should reuse shared CSS classes rather than redefining common styles. The modal system provides base classes for buttons, footers, and layout that work consistently across all modals.

### Button classes

Use these standard button classes for modal actions:

| Class | Use case | Visual style |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| `btn btn-ok` | Positive/confirmatory actions (Save, Create, Confirm) | Solid blue background, white text |
| `btn btn-cancel` | Dismissive/negative actions (Cancel, Close, Delete) | Transparent with accent border |

Footer button order convention: positive action first (left), negative action second (right).

Example footer markup:

```html
<div class="modal-footer" data-modal-footer>
  <button class="btn btn-ok" @click="$store.myStore.save()">Save</button>
  <button class="btn btn-cancel" @click="window.closeModal('...')">Cancel</button>
</div>
```

### Available shared classes

Before writing component-specific CSS, check `webui/css/modals.css` for:

- `.btn`, `.btn-ok`, `.btn-cancel`, `.btn-field` — button styles
- `.modal-footer` — footer container layout
- `.section`, `.section-title`, `.section-description` — content sections
- `.loading` — shimmer loading placeholder
- `.toolbar-button`, `.toolbar-group` — editor toolbar elements
- Range input styling for sliders

### When to add component-specific CSS

Add styles in your component's `<style>` tag only when:

- The style is truly unique to that component's layout/behavior
- No existing shared class covers the use case
- You need to override a shared class for a specific context (use sparingly)

Avoid redefining `.btn`, `.modal-footer`, or other shared classes in component CSS—this creates inconsistency and maintenance burden.

## Closing behavior (what users expect)

### Close by button

The shell provides a close button (`.modal-close`) that always closes the top modal.

### Close by Escape

`Escape` closes the top modal only (stack semantics).

### Close by click-outside

To avoid accidental close during drag/select, the shell only closes on click-outside when:

- both `mousedown` and `mouseup` occurred on the modal container itself (`.modal`), not on inner content.

---

## Stacking + backdrop + z-index

File: `webui/js/modals.js`

- A single `.modal-backdrop` is used for all modals.
- Z-index logic:
  - Base z-index for modals is `3000`
  - Each modal gets `base + index*20`
  - Backdrop sits below the top modal, and between the top two when multiple modals are open.

Outcome:

- Nested modals don’t “flatten” into each other.
- The backdrop always darkens the page behind the active modal without hiding lower modals incorrectly.

---

## Writing a modal component (conventions)

### File location

Prefer:

- `webui/components/modals/<name>/<name>.html` (+ optional `*-store.js`)

Settings uses:

- `webui/components/settings/settings.html` and nested settings components.

### Recommended HTML skeleton

Use this structure:

- `<head><title>...</title>`
- A `<script type="module">` that imports your store (so it registers before Alpine evaluates bindings)
- `<body>` with:
  - a single root wrapper
  - Alpine lifecycle hooks (`x-create`/`x-init` + `x-destroy`) to run open/cleanup logic
- A `<style>` tag at the bottom of the component file containing all modal-specific styling

Good examples:

- `webui/components/modals/history/history.html`
- `webui/components/modals/context/context.html`
- `webui/components/modals/scheduler/scheduler-modal.html`

### Store conventions

- Define stores via `createStore()` from `webui/js/AlpineStore.js`.
- UI reads state through `$store.<storeName>`.
- Prefer a small public API:
  - `open()` / `openModal()` to open the modal
  - `destroy()` / `cleanup()` to reset transient state

---

## “Don’t” list (keeps the system sane)

- Don’t add `document.addEventListener('alpine:init', ...)` blocks inside component HTML — it conflicts with `initFw.js` ordering and can register handlers twice when components are reloaded.
- Don’t manually manipulate `.modal-inner` or `.modal-scroll` structure — `modals.js` owns the shell and footer-slot mechanics; manual changes create layout/scroll bugs.
- Don’t introduce a new modal overlay system; keep the stack, mixed systems break z-index/backdrop expectations and make nested modals unreliable.
- Don’t assume a modal is the only one open; always write logic that behaves correctly when stacked — `Escape`/close behavior, z-index, and focus should all be “top modal wins”.
- Don’t open a new modal synchronously from another modal’s close handler — it can race stack removal and produce transient z-index/backdrop glitches; schedule via `requestAnimationFrame` if needed.
- Don’t store sensitive data in modal stores without explicit cleanup — stores often outlive a modal’s DOM and can leak values across reopen.
- Don’t rely on modal state persisting across close/reopen cycles — design stores so `open()` rehydrates and `destroy()`/`cleanup()` resets transient state.

---

## Debugging checklist

### Modal opens but content never appears

- Verify the path passed to `openModal()` is correct and resolves under `webui/components/`.
- Check browser console for fetch/import errors.
- If you use `<script type="module" src="...">` in the component, ensure the URL is correct.

### Footer is inside the scroll area (not pinned)

- Ensure your footer element has the `data-modal-footer` attribute.
- Ensure it exists after the component loads (if you gate it behind `x-if`, ensure the store is available).

### Closing behavior is weird with nested modals

- Remember `Escape` closes only the top modal.
- `closeModal('some/path.html')` closes that modal wherever it is in the stack.

### Modal opens but `$store.someStore` is undefined

- Ensure the modal HTML imports its store in a `<script type="module">` block (so the store registers before Alpine evaluates bindings).
- Ensure the store name matches what the markup reads (store registered as `createStore("history", ...)` is accessed as `$store.history`).
- If you guard with `<template x-if="$store.someStore">`, verify you’re using the correct store key and not a stale name.

### Modal won’t close / UI feels “stuck”

- `closeModal()` removes the modal element immediately; if your store keeps polling or timers alive, the UI may still feel active—ensure you have `x-destroy` cleanup (`destroy()`/`cleanup()`).
- As a last resort, inspect and remove leftover modal nodes in DevTools (`document.querySelectorAll('.modal').forEach(m => m.remove())`) and reset any store state that assumes the modal is open.

### Inspecting stack/z-index issues

- In DevTools Elements:
  - inspect `.modal` elements (multiple means you have a stack)
  - check the `style="z-index: ..."` on `.modal-inner`
  - verify `.modal-backdrop` exists and sits between modals when stacked
- If the footer is not pinned, confirm your footer element has `data-modal-footer` and that `.modal-inner` has `.modal-with-footer`.
